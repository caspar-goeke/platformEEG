# Platform_EEG

Repository for the analysis of the Platform EEG experiment.

## Structure
Since we will also work over distance it is crucial that we have some structure for our work. In addition to using issues and the wiki we should use the different branches model for working.

## Workflow
For each bug or feature create an issue! If you feel the urge to work on something create a branch from develop. Then do whatever you want to do on this branch. As soon as you think you fixed the bug or created the feature create a pull request (if you want people to look over your work or discuss) or immediately merge to dev.
